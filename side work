so bit shifting left, multiplys the decimal value by 2^n , where n = number of times bit shifted
bit shifting right, divides decimal value by 2^n.
when bit shifting, rounds down

for frequncies:
notes follow this formula:
 f = 2n/12*440
 https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/j3q0i3/how_can_you_calculate_the_frequency_of_a_given/#:~:text=The%20formula%20is%20f%20%3D%202,semitone%20is%2021%2F12.
 "The formula is f = 2n/12*440, where n is the number of semitones above or below A4. This is because the frequency ratio of an equal-tempered semitone is 2^(1/12)."

converting frequencies to delay
1/freq = period
period / (1/50 mill) = delay

so what needs to happen?
there should be a variable that represents n,
when you press up or down arrow, it should increment or decrement this variable n
using the formula f = asdasd it should find the frequency to output
convert the frequency into delay
make this the delay


it would be really cool if we could do sharps and flats

https://producelikeapro.com/blog/note-frequency-chart/

delay = 50,000,000 / (baseFreq << n);
OR
delay = 50,000,000 / (baseFreq >> n);

ok it works!
