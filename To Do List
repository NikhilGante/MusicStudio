To Do:

This week (Week 10):
-finish connecting keyboard to speakers and making notes sounds
-decay of volume
-adding notes sounds
-allow for different octaves (either by using arrow keys to go up/down and octave or shift/caps)

thought process

octave shifting
-doubles or halves frequency
-in binary, if you do a bit shift you are basically multiplying by 2
-if press up arrow, or down arrow, in the same way its detecting the other letters, it should set a variable, incrememnts or decrements this variable. in fsm part, if this variable is  <0 , >0 left shift right shift
-

tapering off of notes volume
-have it be an option toggle? like caps lock
-array, convert exponential function into discrete points, stored in register (just an array), iterate through the register at a certain amt of clock cycles depending on how fast you want it to decay
